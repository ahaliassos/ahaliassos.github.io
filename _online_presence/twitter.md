I started my own [academic Twitter account](https://twitter.com/RodrigomiraA) where I regularly publish updates on my research. I find this is a good way to share my findings with the community and discover emerging research trends. I also engage in discussions with other members of the community. Overall, I find that Twitter is a great way to maintain a connection with the broader machine learning community, and I try to contribute as much as possible.
