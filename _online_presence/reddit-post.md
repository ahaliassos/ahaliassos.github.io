Posted on [r/machinelearning](https://www.reddit.com/r/machinelearning) about my experience with ResNets, and my lack of success with other recent vision models such as EfficientNet. This generated a lot of attention, and many researchers agreed with the points I made. Post has 204 upvotes (97% upvoted) and 34 comments in total.
