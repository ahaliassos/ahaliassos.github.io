👋 Hi, I'm a PhD student at [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/) in the Department of Computing, supervised by [Maja Pantic](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ygpxbK8AAAAJ&hl=en) and [Björn Schuller](http://www.schuller.one/) in [IBUG (Intelligent Behaviour Understanding Group)](https://ibug.doc.ic.ac.uk/). I will be submitting my thesis and finishing my PhD in January 2022. 

🖥️ I spent a substantial portion of my PhD interning and working at [Meta AI](https://ai.facebook.com/), where I collaborated with multiple teams and developed my PhD research. Details are available on the [Experience section](/experience/).

📚 I completed my BSc in Information Systems and Computer Engineering at [Instituto Superior Técnico](https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/pt/) and my MSc in Advanced Computing at [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/). Details are available on the [Education section](/education/).

🔬🤖 My research is focused on deep learning applied to audio-visual speech (i.e., faces, lip movements and speech). In particular, I am interested in applying self-supervised learning to learn from unlabelled audio-visual speech. I am also interested and have experience in generative modelling, particularly in generating speech using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). Details are available on the [Publications section](/publications/).

🗣️ I have given live talks about my research in multiple conferences including [CVPR](/talks/wss-2022), [Interspeech](/talks/oral-interspeech-2022) and [ICASSP](/talks/icassp-2020). I also engage with the machine learning online community directly through platforms such as [Twitter](https://twitter.com/RodrigomiraA) and [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/MiraoDaSilva). Details are available on the [Talks](/talks/) and [Online Presence](/online_presence/) sections.

🎸🎾 During my free time, I enjoy playing the guitar and bass (usually with a band). I also play squash with my colleagues from [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/) on a weekly basis. Details are available on the [Extra-curricular section](/extra_curricular/).

📃 My CV is available on the [CV section](/cv/).
